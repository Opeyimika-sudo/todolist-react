# Todo List with React

This is a todo list built with React. You can create to-do items, check and uncheck whether or not it is completed and delete them when completed. You can even filter them based on completion. Wanna see the completed tasks, sure. Click the "Completed" filter. You can even change to Dark mode and back as you deem fit. The site stores your todos in localStorage, that way there is longevity and you find your tasks even after a long time of checking the website.
